## Lombardo Chat Demo
_Wow, who could resist hiring the genius that made this?_  
(built on [react-redux-boilerplate](https://github.com/flexdinesh/react-redux-boilerplate) - tho I ended up stripping most of it out)

#### Run Locally:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/robertlombardo/chat-demo
cd chat-demo
npm install
npm start
```
You can now test the app at http://localhost:3000

#### Test a Deployed Build:

##### Thanks for being you!
